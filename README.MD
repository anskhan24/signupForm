# Login/Signup Form

This is a simple login/signup form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to either sign up for a new account or log in to an existing one. The form includes fields for a user's name, email, and password.

## Getting Started
To get started, simply download the project files and open the index.html file in your web browser of choice. From there, you should be able to see the login/signup form and interact with it as a user would.

## Usage
To use the login/signup form, simply fill in the fields with your name, email, and password. If you're signing up for a new account, make sure to click the "Sign Up" button. If you're logging in to an existing account, click the "Login" button instead.
